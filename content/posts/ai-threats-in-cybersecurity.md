# Understanding AI Threats in Cybersecurity

Artificial intelligence presents unique challenges in cybersecurity. AI systems can be used to automate attacks, making them more efficient and difficult to detect. Furthermore, AI can be leveraged to develop malware that learns and evolves, bypassing traditional security measures.

## Common AI Threats

- **AI-Powered Phishing Attacks**: These attacks use AI to customize phishing messages that are more likely to deceive the recipients.
- **Automated Attack Drones**: AI can control attack drones to exploit vulnerabilities at scale.

Understanding these threats is the first step toward developing more robust defense mechanisms against AI-powered cyber attacks.
